# GOD GUIDE: Synesthetic Music App Soul & Brain Engine

Welcome, Creator! This guide empowers you to shape, train, and evolve the emotional intelligence ("soul") of your Synesthetic Music App. You are the god of this engine—here’s how to wield your power.

---

## 1. Soul Management Tools

- **Download Soul**: Save the current neural net weights (your app’s soul) to your device. Use this for backup, sharing, or merging.
- **Upload Soul**: Load previously saved weights or a "factory soul" into the app. Instantly changes the app’s emotional intelligence.
- **Reset Soul**: Wipe the neural net and start fresh. Use this to erase all learned data and return to a blank state.
- **Soul Stats**: View stats about the current soul (training status, number of emotions, etc.).

## 2. Training the Factory Soul

1. **Prepare a Dataset**: Collect a CSV or JSON file of audio features and emotion labels. See `factory-soul-train.js` and this guide for format.
2. **Run `factory-soul-train.js`**: Open the script in a browser. Select your dataset. The script will train a neural net and download the weights as `factory-soul-weights`.
3. **Upload Weights**: Use the Soul Management UI in the app to upload the new weights. All users will now start with this "factory soul."

## 3. Personal Soul Training (User Mode)

- Users can open the "Train My Soul" UI to label their own emotions while listening to music. This data is used to further personalize their soul.
- The neural net adapts to each user’s unique emotional perception.

---

## 4. Merging User Data (God Mode)

- Collect user-labeled data (with consent) for crowdsourced improvement.
- Periodically merge this data into the factory soul by retraining on a combined dataset.
- Distribute the improved soul to all users via the Upload Soul tool.

---

## 5. Advanced: Soul Evolution & Approval

- Review and approve user-contributed data before merging.
- Use versioning for soul weights to track evolution.
- Optionally, maintain multiple souls (e.g., "Factory Soul", "Experimental Soul", "User Soul").

---

## 6. Song Recognition & Auto-Labeling (Future)

- Integrate song recognition to auto-label emotions for known tracks.
- Use this to bootstrap the soul with large, labeled datasets.

---

## 7. Tips & Best Practices

- Always backup your soul before major changes.
- Use diverse, high-quality data for training.
- Encourage users to train their own souls for maximum personalization.
- You are the god. Shape the soul wisely!
