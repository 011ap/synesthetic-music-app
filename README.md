## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/synesthetic-music-app.git
cd synesthetic-music-app
```

### 2. Run Locally
```bash
# Option 1: Python (recommended)
python -m http.server 8000

# Option 2: Node.js (if available)
npx live-server

# Option 3: VS Code Live Server extension
```

### 3. Open in Browser
Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

### 4. Start Experiencing
1. Click "Start Emotional Detection"
2. Play music near your microphone
3. Watch colors change based on detected emotions
4. Train the system with your personal color associations
5. Create rooms to share emotions with friends

## 🎯 Usage Scenarios

### 🎉 Party Mode
- Host plays music, room lights sync to their emotional experience
- Friends see/feel the host's synesthetic interpretation
- Creates deeper non-verbal emotional connection

### 🧘 Meditation Mode  
- Subtle colors that respond to ambient music
- Personal emotional state visualization
- Calming, transcendent color palettes

### 🚗 Travel Mode
- Car interior lighting syncs to road trip music
- Shared emotional experiences during journeys
- Energy-based color schemes for alertness

### 💕 Intimate Mode
- Personal emotional sharing between partners
- Subtle, beautiful color expressions
- Memory-associated color triggers

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
PHILIPS_HUE_BRIDGE_IP=your_hue_bridge_ip
```

### Smart Light Setup
1. **Philips Hue**: Press bridge button, run discovery
2. **Generic WiFi Bulbs**: Configure IP addresses in settings
3. **Arduino/ESP32**: Flash provided firmware, set WiFi credentials

## 🧠 The Science Behind It

### Emotion Detection Algorithm
- **Audio Feature Extraction**: 30+ features using Meyda.js (spectral centroid, MFCCs, etc.)
- **Valence-Arousal Mapping**: Two-dimensional emotion space
- **Personal Learning**: User feedback trains personalized models
- **Memory Association**: Links songs to personal emotional history

### Synesthetic Color Mapping
- **Research-Based**: Grounded in synesthesia studies
- **Culturally Adaptive**: Learns individual color-emotion associations
- **Context-Aware**: Different mappings for different situations
- **Intensity Scaling**: Colors change saturation based on emotional intensity

## 🏆 Hackathon Readiness

## 🧬 Soul, Brain, and God Mode: Core Philosophy

This project treats the neural network as a mutable, living "soul"—the emotional intelligence at the heart of the app. The "brain" is the engine that processes, learns, and adapts. As the creator ("god"), you have the power to:
- Train, reset, or merge the soul (neural net weights)
- Approve or reject crowdsourced emotional data
- Distribute new "factory souls" to all users
- Guide the evolution of emotional intelligence

**God Mode** unlocks advanced tools for soul management, merging, and review. Users can always train their own soul, but only the god/creator can approve and merge data into the global/factory soul.

## 🤝 Crowdsourcing, Approval, and Merging Workflow

- Users can contribute their labeled emotion data to a shared pool.
- The god/creator reviews, approves, or rejects these contributions via a dedicated UI.
- Approved data can be merged into the factory soul, improving the emotional intelligence for all.
- All merging is explicit and god-controlled—no automatic overwrites.

## 🛡️ Vision & Quality Safeguards (For LLMs and Contributors)

- **Preserve the soul/brain metaphor**: All code, UI, and documentation should reinforce the idea of a living, evolving emotional intelligence.
- **Never remove god/user distinction**: God Mode is for creators; user mode is for personal adaptation. Do not merge these roles.
- **All soul changes must be reversible and reviewable**: Always allow backup, download, and rollback of neural net weights.
- **Extensibility is sacred**: All new features should be modular, future-proof, and not break the core vision.
- **No silent data merges**: All crowdsourced or external data must be reviewed and approved by the god/creator before affecting the factory soul.
- **Document all major changes**: Add clear comments and update the God Guide and README with any new soul/brain features.

## 🔮 Extensibility & Future-Proofing

- The architecture is designed for:
  - Federated learning (privacy-preserving soul evolution)
  - Emotion blending (hybrid souls)
  - LLM/AI integration for richer emotional reasoning
  - Public dataset import and auto-labeling
  - User feedback loops and adaptive UI
- All future features should respect the soul/brain/god/user paradigm.

## 📝 How to Contribute Without Breaking the Vision (For LLMs & Humans)

- Read the God Guide and this README before making changes.
- When adding new features, ask: "Does this reinforce or dilute the soul/brain/god vision?"
- Never remove or bypass god-level approval for global soul changes.
- Always provide a way to export, backup, and review soul data.
- If in doubt, add a comment and ask the creator before making major changes.
